React is JS library to build UI.
UI is managed by state.

COMPONNETS=> The COMPONNETS in react are independant , isolated and reusable.
2types- 1. class based components 2. function based components

//BABEL
In react the code is written in JSX. 
JSX is the mixture of HTML , CSS,JS.
Browser can't understand JSX and can only understand js

babel is medium to convert jsx=>js

Functional components Syntax
function hello(){
    return(
        //jsx code
    )
}

//Render=> takes the components on ui , reflect changes
To attatch the comp or call fnc we use Render
ReactDOM.render(comp whose material is needed , where to attatch);
eg:-ReactDOM.render(<Hellos/>,document.getElementById('root')); => hellos ka data id pe attatch krdo

React.Fragment is used to wrap the multiple items and render it.

in react we can only use 
?=>ternary operator =====|
map fnc                  | => these restrictions are only for return block
no loops         ========|

Props send data from parent to child
passed to arguement of a function

//static ui use =>function components
//dynamic => use class components because they have state

//STATE
It enables the dynamic nature.
It is built in react OBJECT used to contain data or info about components
Whenever state changes the components re render themselves

 this.state.count= this.state.count+1; never ever change the state of react  directly
 this.setState => use this to change the state 

super();//isse hume this milta h class ka


//SEARCHING
searching temporary operation
jo ki har render pe perform 
state capture jese ip box me chng state set render again
text type basis pe search 
new array will be made that is initially empty
To check we use includes method

The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
It return a  Boolean which is true if the value searchElement is found within the array (or the part of the array indicated by the index fromIndex, if specified)
//Syntax:- includes(searchElement, fromIndex)


//SORTING
We call the sort function on an array.
It return a new array. And no copy is made
It first convers to the string then compares the values or sort.
Give a compare function.
It takes 2 arguements (a,b)

If compareFunction(a, b) returns a value > than 0, sort b before a.
If compareFunction(a, b) returns a value ≤ 0, leave a and b in the same order.

//slice method

The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

/***********************life cycle methods***********************/
3 phases
1.Mounting phase 
2.update
3.Unmount
MOUNTING:- CONSTRUCTOR => RENDER => COMPONENTDIDMOUNT (First component gets mount and then this method is run) (Mounting is done only once on particular component)
UPDATE:- RENDER=> COMPONENTDIDUPDATE (First component gets mount and then this method is run) (Rendering occurs multiple times on particular component)
UNMOUNT :- COMPONENTWILLUNMOUNT (First this method is run and then component gets unmount) (Unmounting is done only once on particular component)

What do we do in ComponentDidMount?
We create side effects.Side Effects basically are network requests on Browser.
componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree).

* Getting data from backend in the constructor is not a quick process as compared when data is in local storage, therefore the react app becomes slow
  so to avoid it, we do the fetching of data from backend in the componentDidMount() function since it runs after the constructor and render function who loads the 
  UI of the app, and then CdidMOUNT() appends the data into the app. Thus handling the side effects of the app. 

Axios:- Promisified library(Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js)
installation:- npm i axios

/***********************Routing***********************/

 A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and
 renders the first one that matches the current URL.
 exact keyword make the component match exactly to path and then only renders it.

 <Link>
 Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application.
<Link to="/about"> basically we write ki link kha pe => link to this path

 /***********************HOOKS***********************/
 Hooks:- Hooks are the functions that let you hook into the react state & lifecycle methods from functional components..
 Hooks don't work in class components.
 Called inside a function
It let's functional components to make their state and lifecycles.
It lets us add local state to React function components 

Need?
1.Escape boiler plate code ffrom class components.
2.No worries to handle this.
3.Seperation of logics.
 
useState:- It is a Hook that let us add state to functional components.
useState returns a pair(Array): the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
Function is  similar to [this.setState] in a class.
The only argument to useState is the initial state.

in class component 
this.state={
    count =0; // ye thi vha initial value that is now passed as an arguement in use state as its initial state.

}
this.setState({
   count: updated value //this updation of state is done by the functiion
    });

Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object.
//update state
To updte the state instead of using count: this.state.count + 1  we use 
the function passed to update the state 
  setCount(count-1);

//Reading state
When we want to display the current count in a class, we read this.state.count but here we directly write {function name}

React will then re-render the function component, passing the new count value to it.
//EVERYTIME STATE WILL CHANGE THE WHOLE FUNCTION WILL RE RENDER.
